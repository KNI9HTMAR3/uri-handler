# Steam URI Handler

This is a simple HTML page that redirects users to `steam://` URIs for opening Steam apps or games. It's designed as a workaround for Discord, which discontinued support for clickable `steam://` links, making it unreliable or impossible to launch Steam directly from Discord messages.

## Usage

Visit https://KNI9HTMAR3.github.io/steam-uri-handler/?appid=730 to open CS in Steam.

## Notes

- Requires Steam installed.
- Auto closes the tab after opening.
