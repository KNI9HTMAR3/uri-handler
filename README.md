# URI Handler

A simple web-based URI handler for **Steam** and **Epic Games Store** links. Designed as a workaround for platforms like Discord that don't support native URI schemes.

## Usage

### Steam

```
https://kni9htmar3.github.io/uri-handler/steam/?id={appid}
```

**Example:** [Open CS2 in Steam](https://kni9htmar3.github.io/uri-handler/steam/?id=730)

### Epic Games

```
https://kni9htmar3.github.io/uri-handler/epic/?slug={slug}
```

**Example:** [Open Styx in Epic](https://kni9htmar3.github.io/uri-handler/epic/?slug=styx-shards-of-darkness-77c030)

## Notes

- Requires Steam / Epic Games Launcher installed.
- Auto closes the tab after opening.
